<p class="bodytext">
<p class="bodytext">

This is a bug-fix release affecting the tuxracer Linux package only.
This release fixes a bug that allowed cheating in cup mode (yes, I
know some of you will be dissapointed :-).  The configure script has also
been completely rewritten -- it now checks for all OpenGL
requirements, and finds OpenGL and Tcl in more locations.

</p>
<p class="bodytext">

<b>Update (Oct. 15, 11:30 PM EST):</b> I've discovered some problems
with the configure script in 0.60.2, so I've released 0.60.3, which
fixes those problems.  If you downloaded 0.60.2 and it worked,
there's no need to get 0.60.3, as the code hasn't changed at all.

Tux Racer 0.60 has been released.  This is the
first public release of the game since Sunspire Studios joined the
development. The game now sports a completely revised interface, new
gameplay features, improved graphics, sound and music, and
joystick support. Both Linux and Windows versions of the
game can be downloaded from the <A HREF="./download.html" >Downloads</A> section.

<p class="bodytext">

I'm very happy to announce that Tux Racer is now being developed by
<A HREF="http://www.sunspirestudios.com/" >Sunspire Studios</A>, a <I>very</I> talented team of artists and
developers (which happens to include me ;-).  This is great
news, since it means that Tux Racer development will proceed at a much
faster rate.  And you needn't worry -- Tux Racer will continue to be
an open source game.

</p>
<p class="bodytext">

We've been working hard on the game over the past couple of weeks;
here's a partial list of the new features that have been completed and
will be appearing in the next release:
</p>

<UL>
    <LI>Audio support (sound effects and music)
    <LI>Sky cubes (much nicer backgrounds and sky)
    <LI>Hard turns (Tux can now carve his way through a course)
    <LI>Jumping and flapping (increased air time!)
    <LI>Much improved camera modes
    <LI>Multiple tree types
    <LI>Course boundaries now definable by course designer
    <LI>Tux now leaves tracks in the snow as he slides
    <LI>Tux can do kewl tricks (flips and barrel rolls)
</UL>

<p class="bodytext">
... and there's lots more in the works.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">

Of course, our changes are being committed to the Tux Racer CVS
repository, so if you're impatient you can have a sneak peak (we try
to keep the CVS version working, though of course there's no guarantee
of that).

</p>
<p class="bodytext">

We're working towards a first milestone release in a couple of weeks.

<p class="bodytext">

It's been a long time since this page was last updated.  The bad news
is that I haven't had time to work on Tux Racer much over the last few
months.  The good news is that that has changed, and Tux Racer
development has resumed. (In fact, I now have help -- more about that
soon.) We hope to have a new release out soon (i.e., this month), so
stay tuned!

<p class="bodytext">

The latest CVS version includes changes that allow tuxracer to
compiler with <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/" >Cygwin</A>.  I've also created a Win32 binary and put

<p class="bodytext">

<p class="bodytext">

Based on user feedback, I've recently been working on enhancing the
performance of Tux Racer.  One of the things that I've done is to
render the terrain with varying levels of detail (LOD) -- roughly
speaking, terrain that is closer to the camera is rendered with more
detail.  Combined with some other performance enhancements (view
frustum culling, optimization of the Tux model), I've been able to
improve framerates by 30-40% on my system (more if I sacrifice
some detail).

</p>
<p class="bodytext">

This code is only in CVS at the moment; if you're adventurous you can
get it from <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2944" >SourceForge</A>.  Here's a
<A HREF="">wireframe screenshot</A> showing the
terrain LOD code in action.  (<b>Update 19-Mar-2000</b>: here's a
<A HREF="">screenshot</A> with the LOD code turned off,
for comparison.)

</p>
<p class="bodytext">

I believe that this makes Tux Racer the first open-source game to
feature adaptive LOD terrain.  Many thanks to <A HREF="mailto:tu@tulrich.com" >Thatcher
Ulrich</A>, whose code was used (see Thatcher's excellent
