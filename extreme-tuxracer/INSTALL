Basic Installation
==================
Note: These instructions are not guaranteed to be perfect, and do not cover all systems.
If you have to do things differently to get Extreme Tux Racer to compile, please let us
know by adding the information to the wiki.
Thanks!

== Dependencies ==
Debian/Ubuntu
  Note: This probably also applies for other Debian-based systems.

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

    * build-essential
    * libsdl1.2-dev
    * libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
    * tcl8.4-dev 

You may also need:
    * libfreetype6-dev
    * xlibs-dev

Other systems
    You will need the packages equivalent to the above for your system.  If
    you can tell us what they are and how to install them on your system,
    we'll try to include that information in the next release and on the
    wiki.

== Configuring and Building ==
  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code (probably
     this directory) and type `./configure' to configure the package for
     your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. If 'configure' ends saying "configure complete, now type 'make' and
     pray", then type `make' to compile the package.  If not, you may
     need to install additional dependencies.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.  You will need to do this as root (or using sudo).

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.
