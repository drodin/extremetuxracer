This is the course "Ski Jump" for Tuxracer.

The idea behind this course was to design a course similar to a real ski-jump
where you can see the distance your penguin has flown. After the take off you can see
lines in the snow, which each line being 10 metres away from the others. For a better
overview the distance is written in the snow every 50 metres.
By pressing the "e" on your keyboard you can use the ergonometer on the ski-jump-table.
This plus flapping the wings in the air, will enable the penguin to fly up to 200 m. ;-)
