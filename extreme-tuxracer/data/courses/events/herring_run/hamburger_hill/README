Hamburger Hill - 2002 by George Veeder

Hamburger Hill is steep, narrow, twisty, lumpy, icy, and rocky, with a few
trees thrown in right in your way! Thank goodness this game doesn't injure
your penguin when you crash, otherwise he'd be ground beef by the time he got
to the bottom!

You'll have a lot of trouble staying on the ground in some areas, and it will
be hard to get a good time AND a good score.

Good luck and enjoy!
